## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<h3>SOLUTION</h3>
<ul><li>The proposed solution is a Smart Crop Advisory App that helps small and marginal farmers with easy and useful farming advice. The app gives crop suggestions, detects pests and diseases, shows weather forecasts, and guides fertilizer use – all in one simple platform. Farmers can take a photo of their crop, and the app will use AI to find problems and give quick remedies. It also suggests the best crops and the right amount of fertilizer based on soil, season, and location, so farmers can get better yield at lower cost. Weather alerts help farmers plan their work and protect crops from damage. The app supports many Indian languages and voice features, so even farmers who cannot read well can use it. By using AI, government data, and simple design, this app helps farmers make better decisions, improve harvests, and earn more in a sustainable way.</li>
<li>This solution helps farmers by giving them the right advice at the right time. Many small farmers face problems like not knowing which crop to grow, how much fertilizer to use, how to control pests, or how to deal with sudden weather changes. Our app solves these problems by suggesting suitable crops, detecting plant diseases from photos, giving weather updates, and guiding fertilizer use. It also works in many Indian languages and supports voice, so even farmers who cannot read easily can use it. Since it works on normal smartphones and can run offline, farmers in villages with less internet can also benefit. By using this app, farmers can grow better crops, reduce losses, and earn more income.</li>
<li>My solution is special because it uses AI, weather updates, and voice support all in one app. Unlike other apps that give general advice, this one gives personal advice based on the farmer’s soil, crop, and location. Farmers can take a photo of their crop, and the app will tell if there is a pest or disease and how to fix it. It also works offline in villages with less internet and supports many Indian languages with voice, so even farmers who cannot read well can use it. This makes the solution new, different, and very useful for small farmers.</li></ul>
