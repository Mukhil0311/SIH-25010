## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<h3>SOLUTION</h3>
<ul><li>The Smart Crop Advisory App is a complete digital solution created to support small and marginal farmers by giving them useful advice for better farming. Many farmers face challenges such as not knowing which crop will grow best in their soil, how much fertilizer they should use, how to detect pests or diseases, or how to deal with sudden weather changes. This app combines all these solutions into one easy-to-use platform. One of its important features is crop suggestion, where the app recommends the best crops to grow depending on the soil type, season, and location. This helps farmers increase yield and reduce cost. Another key feature is pest and disease detection. Farmers can take a photo of their crop, and the app uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to find whether the plant is affected. If a problem is detected, the app gives instant remedies and control measures. The app also provides weather forecasts and alerts, helping farmers plan their farming activities and protect crops from damage due to heavy rain, storms, or heatwaves. Along with this, the app guides farmers on the right type and quantity of fertilizers needed for each crop, saving money and preventing soil damage. To make it farmer-friendly, the app supports many Indian languages and offers voice guidance, so even farmers who cannot read well can use it easily. Another big advantage is that the app works in offline mode, which is helpful for farmers in villages where internet connectivity is weak. This solution is special because it does not give general advice like many other apps; instead, it provides personalized suggestions by using AI, government data, and weather updates. The app is simple in design but powerful in features, making it easy to use even for farmers with little technical knowledge. By using this app, farmers can grow healthier crops, reduce losses, improve productivity, and earn more income. It also helps them make smart farming decisions, save resources, and practice farming in a more sustainable way. In short, this app works like a digital farming assistant that gives the right advice at the right time, improving both the livelihood of farmers and the future of agriculture.</li>
<li>This solution helps farmers by giving them the right advice at the right time. Many small farmers face problems like not knowing which crop to grow, how much fertilizer to use, how to control pests, or how to deal with sudden weather changes. Our app solves these problems by suggesting suitable crops, detecting plant diseases from photos, giving weather updates, and guiding fertilizer use. It also works in many Indian languages and supports voice, so even farmers who cannot read easily can use it. Since it works on normal smartphones and can run offline, farmers in villages with less internet can also benefit. By using this app, farmers can grow better crops, reduce losses, and earn more income.</li>
<li>My solution is special because it uses AI, weather updates, and voice support all in one app. Unlike other apps that give general advice, this one gives personal advice based on the farmer’s soil, crop, and location. Farmers can take a photo of their crop, and the app will tell if there is a pest or disease and how to fix it. It also works offline in villages with less internet and supports many Indian languages with voice, so even farmers who cannot read well can use it. This makes the solution new, different, and very useful for small farmers.</li></ul>
